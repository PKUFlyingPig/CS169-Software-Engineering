# UCB CS169 : Software Engineering

This repository contains my learning materials for the online course of UC Berkeley —— CS169 : Software Engineering. This course is not open to the public, but on EdX, you can take a set of three courses, covering the introductory and advanced material in the corresponding textbook respectively, called **Agile SaaS Development**.

You can find more materials on the [official website](http://www.saasbook.info/videos)

## Resources

To master all the materials, you may 1) watch the videos 2) read the book 3) do the coding homework (called CHIPS in book)

Below are the links to the repository of my CHIPS implementation:
